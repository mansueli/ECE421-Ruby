*What is a sparse matrix and what features should it possess?*
    Sparse matrix are matrix with at least 51% of its number being zero values or one with enough zeros to take advantage of. Another feature that each sparse matrix have is the sparsity which is the ratio of zero numbers to nonzero values numbers.

*What sources of information should you consult to derive features? Do analogies exist? If so with what?*
    Look at the usages of sparse matrices and existing libraries for sparse matrices (for ex. MATLAB). Could be analogous to a bridge structure where most parts of the structure are not under stress from outside forces and specific points carry the majority of the load. Solve PDEs with complex boundaries.

*Who is likely to be the user of a sparse matrix package? What features are they likely to demand?*
    Researchers (Solve PDEs), Engineers (Civil). They will probably demand:
  Sparse Matrix Creation
Sparse identity matrix
Sparse distributed random matrix
Import matrix
Sparse Matrix Manipulation
Determine whether input is sparse
Number of nonzero matrix elements
Nonzero matrix elements
Replace nonzero sparse matrix elements with ones
Find indices and values of nonzero elements
Convert sparse matrix to full matrix
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix
Convert sparse matrix to full matrix
Find indices and values of nonzero elements

*What is a tri-diagonal matrix?*
    It is a matrix where only numbers on the main diagonal, the diagonal above, and the diagonal below are non-zero.
